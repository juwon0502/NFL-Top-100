# NFL Top 100

Since 2010, the NFL network has released a show ranking the "Top 100 Players in the NFL" voted by the players. 

Using the Rankings of the last 10 years, what kind of things can we uncover?

* Can the top 10/15/20 players of the 2020 season be predicted based on historical data?
* What team has had the best players of the past 10 years?
* What players have been the most consistent?

Ranking data and player statistics was scraped through the Beautiful Soup library


Some changes that I made:
- Left off Full Backs from offensive playmakers as it makes up only 0.3% of the rankings and it's a slowly fading position
- Changed St. Louis, San Diego, Oakland to their new respective team-location abbreviations (as well as the Washington Football Team)
